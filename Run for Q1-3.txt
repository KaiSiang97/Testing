To create a Windows scheduled task that triggers a PowerShell script to run at Windows startup and starts an application, follow these steps:

Create the PowerShell script:
Create a new text file and save it with a .ps1 extension (e.g., startup.ps1).
Add the PowerShell script to start your application. For example, you can use the Start-Process cmdlet to launch your application. Modify the script according to your specific application startup requirements.
Here's an example of the PowerShell script to start an application (replace "C:\Path\to\your\application.exe" with the path to your application):

(powershell)
# Start the application
Start-Process "C:\Path\to\your\application.exe"
Open Task Scheduler:

Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog.
Type taskschd.msc and press Enter to open Task Scheduler.
Create a new task:

In the Task Scheduler window, click on "Create Basic Task" or "Create Task" in the right-hand pane (depending on your Windows version).
Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the task:
Enter a name and optional description for the task.
Choose "At startup" or "When the computer starts" as the trigger.
Select "Start a program" as the action.
Browse and select the PowerShell executable (powershell.exe) as the program to run.
In the "Add arguments" field, enter the path to your PowerShell script file (e.g., "C:\Path\to\startup.ps1").
Click Next and follow the remaining steps to complete the task creation.
Set optional additional settings:

In the task properties, you can set additional settings such as configuring user account credentials, setting up delays or triggers, or specifying conditions for the task to run.
Modify the settings according to your requirements.
Review and confirm the task configuration.
Test the scheduled task:

Restart your computer to test if the PowerShell script runs at Windows startup.
Verify that your application starts as expected.
By following these steps, you can create a scheduled task in Windows Task Scheduler that triggers the execution of your PowerShell script at Windows startup, ensuring that your application is launched automatically.
